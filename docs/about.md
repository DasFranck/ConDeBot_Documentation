ConDeBot is a Discord bot written in Python I sometimes work on as a hobby, so it's kinda my main personal project.  

Its purpose isn't to concurrence notorious bots as Mee6 or Red, but to be useful for me and my friends while being a project I can be proud and having fun coding.

It was initially an IRC bot based on Weechat API I made in 2015 to learn and practice python, inspired by some bots wandering on #archlinux-fr@freenode.
